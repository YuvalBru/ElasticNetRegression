# Predicting the price of cars using Elastic Net Regression

In this project we take data which we web scraped out of an advertising website for all sorts of sales and we build using the the said data an Elastic Net Regression model we train the model.

We then take the model and test it's goodness of fit using RMSE and then we examine our features and their coefficients we then take the top 5 most "important" coefficients in the trained model and list them.
